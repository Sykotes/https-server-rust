# HTTPS server written in rust

This is a personal project where I modified the HTTP server example from *The Rust Programming Language* book to add TLS support and make it HTTPS.

It was mainly an experiment to learn more about HTTP, TLS, and Rustâ€™s networking capabilities.

The core functionality remains the same as the original example.
